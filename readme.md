**CSS / Javascript Clock**

Just playing around.

It's been done countless times before, but was just brushing up with some CSS3 transforms, coffeescript, and let's face it â€“ arithmetic. I plan to expand it in the future to have more features like an alarm, stopwatch, AM/PM or 24 hour time, World clocks.

Replicating at least the functionality of the iOS clock app with web technologies is a good starting point for experimentation, and I hope the resource can be valuable for me and others (the CSS if not the admittedly basic javascript).
